# Exploring FAIR Scientific Datasets with Python

Welcome to **Exploring FAIR Scientific Datasets with Python**, a Jupyter Book dedicated to helping you access and visualise interesting FAIR-compliant scientific datasets using Python. Each chapter focuses on a different dataset that could be useful to a broad range of scientists or the general public, guiding you through the process of retrieving, analysing, and plotting the data.

You don't need to be an Python expert - this tutorial series should be suitable for beginners.

## About the Book

This book is for anyone interested in:
- Learning how to access publicly available scientific datasets.
- Creating meaningful visualisations using Python.
- Understanding the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data and how it applies to real-world datasets.

Each chapter is structured to:
1. Introduce a new dataset.
2. Explain how to access it programmatically.
3. Demonstrate visualisation techniques with Python.
